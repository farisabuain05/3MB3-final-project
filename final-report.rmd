## Introduction

*Should be approximately 3 to 5 paragraphs

Introduction: Discuss research literature on different drug delivery methods, past research on the comparative safety and efficacy of IV and pill dosage for real-world. "Really focus on what the reader needs to
know to understand your work, and be interested and excited by it".
 
At the end of the introduction, introduce research question.
 
MORE FORMALIZED RESEARCH QUESTION: Is an IV or slow-release pill dosing strategy more effective for patients with chronic pain relief needs vs acute pain relief needs [doesn't have to be pain relief, but this makes it more specific]? What is the comparative safety of both methods for patients of differing metabolisms / tolerances / something else {can we integrate this into one question??}.
