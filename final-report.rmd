## Introduction

A 2021 report by the Government of Canada’s Pain Task Force found that 1 in 5 Canadians live with some form of chronic pain. This includes 1 in 5 children and youth, as well as 1 in 3 adults over the age of 65 [@CanadaPainTaskForce2021]. Chronic pain often results in a significantly lower quality of life, including (but not limited to) poor sleep, impacted ability to socialize, and inability to work. In addition to chronic pain, acute pain (defined as pain requiring immediate medical attention) is a common occurrence in Canada, accounting for 78% of all emergency department visits [@CASN_Module7A]. As a result, the treatment strategies and methods for the management of pain are a topic of great importance for both medical professionals and policy makers in the Canadian healthcare system. 

Commonly-used medications for the treatment and management of pain include acetaminophen (Tylenol®), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), topical medications (lidocaine, capsaicin, etc.), and opioids [@Kosharskyy2013IVInfusions]. However, in this report, we will focus on two specific forms of drug delivery: intravenous (IV) administration, and extended-release pills. IV administration involves the infusion of a drug directly into the veins of the patient, and is often completed under medical supervision, in either a hospital or home care setting. In addition to IV administration of opiates such as morphine and fentanyl, commonly used for severe pain in hospitalized patients, non-opiate drugs such as lidocaine, ketamine, and phentolamine have been used for the management of patients with pain stemming from chronic conditions [@Kosharskyy2013IVInfusions]. 

Extended-release pills have also shown significant promise for the treatment of chronic pain, overcoming previous limitations of pill delivery to patients with acute pain only. For example, extended-release opiates are generally preferred for patients with chronic pain as they reduce interruptions of sleep, increase compliance, and offer less reinforcement for drug misuse (a significant concern for opiates) [@Gan2025IVIbuprofen]. Additionally, extended-release formulations of over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications offer similar benefits to patients with lower-grade chronic pain, and are generally effective and well-tolerated for long-term use [@CANJHT_RC1508_2023].  

Recent reviews of the medical literature on the safety and efficacy of long-acting/extended-release opioids for chronic pain have suggested that much of the current body of research is of poor quality and limited scope [@Montgomery2022PainMgmt; @OHSU2019]. In particular, these reviews emphasize the lack of sufficient statistical evidence to make determinations as to comparative safety and efficacy between classes of extended-release drugs. The literature on the safety and efficacy of IV administration is also lacking, with inconclusive results on the safety and efficacy of intravenous administration of pain medications for chronic pain management [@SarziPuttini2012PainMgmt]. Some studies have found that IV administration of ibuprofen (an NSAID) to be effective and well-tolerated in older patients and have suggested IV administration of acetaminophen as a safer alternative to opioids [@Gan2025IVIbuprofen; @CANJHT_RC1508_2023].  

The goal of this report is to investigate the dynamics of drug absorption and metabolism for different methods of drug delivery, through a combination of mathematical modelling and numerical simulation. In particular, we will perform a full mathematical analysis of drug dynamics in the body in order to explore the implications for the safety and efficacy of common pain management strategies. The question we seek to investigate is whether extended-release pills or IV administration is a more effective strategy for patients with chronic and/or acute pain, as well as the relative safety of each strategy given patient metabolism and tolerance.


## Model

# Base Model

Our specific goal is to model the rate of accumulation of drug in the body at different dosages, rates of administration, and patient metabolic rates, as well as the total amount of drug in the body at any particular time during administration. The model we use here is agnostic to the specific drug being administered, and so we assume the drug will be metabolized similarly across drug classes. Specifically, we make the simplifying assumption that the rate of clearance is proportional the current amount of drug in the body. 

We have chosen to model the rate of change in the amount of drug in the body as a continuous process, using an ordinary differential equation:

$$
\frac{dA}{dt} = D(t) - P(A)
$$

where \(D(t)\) is the dosage at time \(t\) and \(P(A)\) is the processing rate. As stated earlier, in our model we assume that the rate of clearance is proportional to the current amount of drug in the body, i.e.

$$
P(A) = cA
$$

for some clearance rate \(0 < c < 1\) (since it is impossible to remove more drug from the body than there currently is at that time). This is a simplification, as it does not take into account that drugs may be processed at different rates throughout the day, depending on the stage of the patient’s circadian rythym, other drugs in the body, stomach contents, etc. [reference 2.1.1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7174881/).  

The dosage at time \(t\), \(D(t)\), will be modelled differently for the IV administration and the extended-release pill delivery strategies. For IV, the dosage at time \(t\) is a constant \(r\), the rate of administration. In clinical settings, IV infusions are generally done at a constant rate, so this assumption is valid [reference 2.1.2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK596734/). This results in the model

$$
\frac{dA}{dt} = r - cA \qquad \text{for } 0 \le t \le h
$$

and after infusion ends,

$$
\frac{dA}{dt} = -cA
$$

For the extended-release pill, we model the dosage at time \(t\) as

$$
D(t) = D_{\max} e^{-t/h}
$$

where \(D_{\max}\) is the max dosage. At time \(t = 0\), the dosage will be \(D_{\max}\) and will decrease as time goes on. This models the fact that, from ingestion, less and less of the drug is released into the body as the pill dissolves. We represent this release rate as exponential decay, with the parameter \(h\) modified to approximate different rates of release/absorption. Hence, we obtain the model

$$
\frac{dA}{dt} = D_{\max} e^{-t/h} - cA
$$

However, this model ignores that the drug isn’t immediately effective once consumed; it first has to be absorbed the by stomach lining into the bloodstream, a process whose speed is affected by the stomach contents, genetics, and current state of the patient [reference 2.1.1, again](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7174881/). Furthemore, this doesn’t take into account that not all of the drug will be absorbed by the patient. This is called the bioavailability of a drug, and varies wildly between different compounds [reference 2.1.3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557852/). Once again, since our model is agnostic to the drug being administered, we simplify by assuming that rate of dosage and rate of absorption are equal, and that no time passes between the release/absorption of the drug and it becoming effective (i.e. acting upon it’s target). 

Note that, for the IV model, our assumption that the drug entering the bloodstream is equivalent to it becoming effective is somewhat supported by the medical literature, as intravenous drug administration is generally considered to provide the most complete drug availability, with minimal delay. [reference 2.1.4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/intravenous-drug-administration).  

# Analysis of Base Model

We wish to find the amount of drug at any particular time \(t\), based on our model for IV administration, in order to determine time to effective dose, maximum amount of drug in the body, and equilibrium amount of drug in the bodu. Recall, from the previous section, that we model change in \(A(t)\), the amount of drug at time \(t\), as

$$
\frac{dA}{dt} = r - cA \qquad \text{for } 0 \le t \le h
$$

and after infusion ends,

$$
\frac{dA}{dt} = -cA
$$

where \( r > 0 \), \( 0 < c < 1 \), and \( t = h \) is the time at which administration stops.  
Since this is a linear, autonomous, first-order ODE, we can solve for \( A(t) \) on the interval \( t \in [0, h] \) as follows:


We start with

$$
\frac{dA}{dt} = r - cA
$$

Rewrite and separate variables:

$$
\frac{1}{\,r - cA\,}\, dA = 1 \, dt
$$

Integrate both sides:

$$
\int \frac{1}{\,r - cA\,} \, dA = \int 1 \, dt
$$

Performing the integrations:

$$
-\frac{1}{c} \ln\!\left( r - cA \right) = t + C
$$

Multiply by \(-c\) and absorb constants:

$$
\ln\!\left( r - cA \right) = -ct + C'
$$

Exponentiate both sides:

$$
r - cA = D e^{-ct}
$$

Solve for \(A(t)\):

$$
A(t) = \frac{r - D e^{-ct}}{c}
$$

Since \(A(0) >= 0\) and \(D e^{-ct} > 0\), with \(D e^{-ct}\) being a monotone decreasing function of t, we know that \(r >= D e^{-c*0} = D\). To find a general solution to our model, note that

$$A_0 = A(0) = \frac{r - D}{c}.$$

Hence, we have that,

$$D = r - cA_0.$$

$$\Rightarrow A(t) = \frac{r - (r - cA_0)e^{-ct}}{c}.$$

$$= \frac{r - re^{-ct} + cA_0 e^{-ct}}{c}.$$

$$= \frac{r - re^{-ct}}{c} + A_0 e^{-ct}.$$

$$= \frac{r}{c}(1 - e^{-ct}) + A_0 e^{-ct}.$$

Observe that for \(A_0 = 0\) (i.e. no drug in patient’s system when administration begins)

$$A(t) = \frac{r}{c}(1 - e^{-ct}).$$

Now, to find the solution for \(A(t)\) after administration ceases, that is on \((h, \infty)\), i.e.

$$\frac{dA}{dt} = -cA.$$

$$\Rightarrow \int \frac{1}{A} \, dA = \int -c \, dt.$$

$$\Rightarrow \ln(A) = -ct + C.$$

$$\Rightarrow A(t) = e^{-ct + C} = Me^{-ct}.$$

To solve for \(M\), observe that \(A(t)\) should be a continuous function, since we are modelling a continuous process.  
That is,

$$\frac{r}{c}(1 - e^{-ch}) + A_0 e^{-ch} = Me^{-ch}.$$

$$\Rightarrow M = \frac{r}{c}(e^{ch} - 1) + A_0.$$

Hence, on \([h, \infty)\)

$$A(t) = \left(\frac{r}{c}(e^{ch} - 1) + A_0\right)e^{-ct}.$$

$$= \frac{r}{c}(e^{c(h - t)} - e^{-ct}) + A_0 e^{-ct}.$$

Therefore, our final solution for \(A(t)\) is:

$$
A(t) =
\begin{cases}
\frac{r}{c}(1 - e^{-ct}) + A_0 e^{-ct}, & (0 \le t \le h), \\
\frac{r}{c}(e^{c(h - t)} - e^{-ct}) + A_0 e^{-ct}, & (t \ge h).
\end{cases}
$$

Now that we have an expression for total amount of drug at any time \(t\), we can turn our attention to finding the equilibrium of the model.  
Fortunately, this is a much simpler endeavor, as we simply set the rate of change, \(\frac{dA}{dt}\), to 0, and solve.

For \(t \in [0, h]\):

$$\frac{dA}{dt} = 0 = r - cA.$$

$$\Rightarrow A = \frac{r}{c}.$$

Hence, the equilibrium of \(A(t)\) during IV administration is \(A(t) = \frac{r}{c}\).  
Is this equilibrium stable? Letting

$$F(A) = \frac{dA}{dt} = r - cA,$$

then

$$F'(A) = -c,$$

where \(c\) is a positive constant, hence \(F'(A) < 0\) for all time \(t\).  
Thus our equilibrium \(E_1\) is stable for all time.  
We can therefore conclude that so long as administration continues, we will eventually reach and settle at an equilibrium amount of \(r/c\) units of drug in the body.

Similarly, on \(t > h\), we have

$$\frac{dA}{dt} = 0 = -cA.$$

$$\Rightarrow A = 0.$$

Since \(c > 0\), thus our equilibrium is 0, as expected, since the drug is eventually eliminated from the body.  
Allowing \(g(A) = -cA\), then

$$g'(A) = -c < 0.$$

So, as before, this equilibrium is stable and we can expect to reach it once administration stops, given sufficient time.


\section{Pill model with exponential release}

\subsection{Model derivation}
Let $A(t)$ denote the amount of drug in the body (mg) at time $t$ (hours).  
Assume linear clearance $P(A)=cA$ with clearance rate $c>0$ (1/hour), and a slowly dissolving pill whose release rate decays exponentially:
\[
D_{\text{pill}}(t)=D_{\max}e^{-t/h},
\]
where $D_{\max}>0$ is the initial release rate (mg/hour) and $h>0$ is a characteristic release time (hours).

Using the inflow-minus-outflow principle,
\[
\frac{dA}{dt}=D_{\text{pill}}(t)-P(A)=D_{\max}e^{-t/h}-cA,
\qquad A(0)=0.
\]

\subsection{Analytical solution for $A(t)$}
This is a linear first-order ODE:
\[
A'(t)+cA(t)=D_{\max}e^{-t/h}.
\]
Use integrating factor $\mu(t)=e^{ct}$. Then
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\!\left(e^{ct}A(t)\right)=D_{\max}e^{ct}e^{-t/h}
= D_{\max}e^{(c-\frac{1}{h})t}.
\]

\paragraph{Case 1: $c\neq \frac{1}{h}$.}
Integrate from $0$ to $t$:
\[
e^{ct}A(t)-A(0)=D_{\max}\int_0^t e^{(c-\frac{1}{h})s}\,ds
= D_{\max}\,\frac{e^{(c-\frac{1}{h})t}-1}{c-\frac{1}{h}}.
\]
With $A(0)=0$, multiply by $e^{-ct}$:
\[
A(t)=\frac{D_{\max}}{c-\frac{1}{h}}\left(e^{-t/h}-e^{-ct}\right),
\qquad (c\neq 1/h).
\]

\paragraph{Case 2: $c=\frac{1}{h}$.}
Then
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\!\left(e^{ct}A(t)\right)=D_{\max},
\]
so
\[
e^{ct}A(t)=D_{\max}t
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
A(t)=D_{\max}t\,e^{-ct},\qquad (c=1/h).
\]

\subsection{Total dosage for the pill model}
Define total administered amount over an administration window $[0,h]$:
\[
D_{\text{tot,pill}}=\int_0^h D_{\max}e^{-t/h}\,dt
= D_{\max}\left[-h e^{-t/h}\right]_{0}^{h}
= D_{\max}h\left(1-e^{-1}\right).
\]
(If instead you treat the pill as releasing indefinitely, then
$\int_0^\infty D_{\max}e^{-t/h}dt=D_{\max}h$.)

\section{Comparison: IV infusion vs pill delivery (Factors 1 and 2)}

\subsection{IV reference model}
For constant IV infusion at rate $r$ (mg/hour) for $0\le t\le h$ and $0$ thereafter:
\[
D_{\text{IV}}(t)=
\begin{cases}
r, & 0\le t\le h,\\
0, & t>h,
\end{cases}
\qquad P(A)=cA,\qquad A(0)=0.
\]
The solution is
\[
A_{\text{IV}}(t)=
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{r}{c}\left(1-e^{-ct}\right), & 0\le t\le h,\\[8pt]
\dfrac{r}{c}\left(1-e^{-ch}\right)e^{-c(t-h)}, & t>h.
\end{cases}
\]

\subsection{Factor 1: Total administrative amount}
\paragraph{IV (over $[0,h]$):}
\[
D_{\text{tot,IV}}=\int_0^h r\,dt=rh.
\]

\paragraph{Pill (over $[0,h]$):}
\[
D_{\text{tot,pill}}=\int_0^h D_{\max}e^{-t/h}\,dt
= D_{\max}h\left(1-e^{-1}\right).
\]

\paragraph{Dose-matching for a fair comparison (common choice).}
If we want both methods to deliver the same total dose over $[0,h]$, set
\[
D_{\text{tot,IV}}=D_{\text{tot,pill}}
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
rh=D_{\max}h(1-e^{-1})
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
D_{\max}=\frac{r}{1-e^{-1}}.
\]

\subsection{Factor 2: Overdose risk (peak $A(t)$ values)}

\paragraph{IV peak.}
On $[0,h]$, $A_{\text{IV}}(t)$ increases monotonically; after $h$ it decays.
Thus the peak occurs at $t=h$:
\[
A_{\text{peak,IV}}=A_{\text{IV}}(h)=\frac{r}{c}\left(1-e^{-ch}\right),
\qquad t_{\text{peak,IV}}=h.
\]

\paragraph{Pill peak (general method).}
For the pill model, the peak occurs when $A'(t)=0$:
\[
0=A'(t)=D_{\max}e^{-t/h}-cA(t)
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
A_{\text{peak,pill}}=\frac{D_{\max}}{c}e^{-t_{\text{peak}}/h}.
\]
Using the explicit $A(t)$ (for $c\neq 1/h$),
\[
A(t)=\frac{D_{\max}}{c-\frac{1}{h}}\left(e^{-t/h}-e^{-ct}\right),
\]
set $A'(t)=0$ and solve:
\[
D_{\max}e^{-t/h}=c\cdot \frac{D_{\max}}{c-\frac{1}{h}}
\left(e^{-t/h}-e^{-ct}\right).
\]
Cancel $D_{\max}$ and rearrange:
\[
e^{-ct}=\frac{1}{ch}\,e^{-t/h}.
\]
Taking logs gives the pill time-to-peak:
\[
t_{\text{peak,pill}}=\frac{\ln(ch)}{c-\frac{1}{h}}
=\frac{h\ln(ch)}{ch-1},
\qquad (c\neq 1/h).
\]
Then the pill peak value can be written compactly as
\[
A_{\text{peak,pill}}=\frac{D_{\max}}{c}\exp\!\left(-\frac{t_{\text{peak,pill}}}{h}\right)
=\frac{D_{\max}}{c}\exp\!\left(-\frac{\ln(ch)}{ch-1}\right),
\qquad (c\neq 1/h).
\]

\paragraph{Special case $c=1/h$.}
Here $A(t)=D_{\max}t e^{-ct}$. Differentiate:
\[
A'(t)=D_{\max}e^{-ct}(1-ct)=0 \;\Longrightarrow\; t_{\text{peak,pill}}=\frac{1}{c}=h,
\]
and thus
\[
A_{\text{peak,pill}}=D_{\max}h e^{-1}.
\]

\paragraph{Overdose-risk statement.}
Given a safety threshold $A_{\text{safe}}$, overdose risk can be assessed by checking whether
\[
A_{\text{peak,IV}}>A_{\text{safe}}
\quad\text{or}\quad
A_{\text{peak,pill}}>A_{\text{safe}}.
\]
Because IV has an easily characterized peak at $t=h$, while the pill peak time
$t_{\text{peak,pill}}=\frac{h\ln(ch)}{ch-1}$ depends on the balance between release ($h$)
and clearance ($c$), the pill can shift (and often reduce) peak exposure relative to IV,
which should be verified with parameter sweeps and plots.

# Clinical Considerations and Numerical Simulations

In this section, we aim to answer under what parameter regimes and
effective threshold values ($A_{eff}$) does a slow-release pill provide
superior therapeutic outcomes compared to rapid intravenous (IV)
infusion. Through comprehensive numerical simulations, we will
systematically vary key parameters; infusion rate ($r$), administration
duration ($h$), clearance rate ($c$), and effective threshold
($A_{eff}$) to map the parameter space where each delivery method
excels. Our analysis builds upon the mathematical models derived in the
previous section.

## Clinical Motivation

In pharmacotherapy, clinicians must balance competing objectives:
achieving rapid therapeutic effect (fast onset) versus maintaining
sustained drug action (long duration). This trade-off is fundamentally
influenced by:

1.  The delivery method (IV infusion vs oral pill)

2.  The minimum effective concentration ($A_{eff}$) required for
    therapeutic action

3.  Patient-specific parameters (clearance rate $c$)

4.  Dosing protocol parameters (infusion rate $r$, administration
    duration $h$)

Understanding these parameter thresholds allows healthcare providers to
select optimal delivery methods for specific therapeutic goals, adjust
dosing protocols based on patient metabolic rates, predict when
switching from IV to oral administration becomes beneficial, and
personalize treatment for fast vs slow metabolizers [@Rowland2011; @StatPearls2024].

## Performance Metrics

For each delivery method and parameter set, we calculate three key
metrics using numerical simulation:\
**Onset Time:** $$t_{onset} = \min\{t : A(t) > A_{eff}\}$$\
This represents how long it takes for the drug to reach therapeutic
levels.\
**Effective Duration:**
$$t_{duration} = \max\{t : A(t) > A_{eff}\} - t_{onset}$$\
This represents how long the drug maintains therapeutic levels.\
**Trade-off Score:** $$\text{Score} = \frac{t_{duration}}{t_{onset}}$$\
A higher score indicates better sustained therapeutic coverage relative
to onset delay.

# Systematic Parameter Analysis

## Effect of Effective Threshold ($A_{eff}$)

### Motivation

Different medications and conditions require different minimum effective
concentrations. We test $A_{eff} \in [20, 200]$ mg to understand how the
therapeutic threshold affects the onset-duration trade-off. For our
numerical simulations we used the following fixed parameters; clearance
rate: $c = 0.1$ hr$^{-1}$, administration duration: $h = 4$ hours, IV
infusion rate: $r = 50$ mg/hr, and pill maximum release: $D_{max} = 200$
mg/hr and analyze the results provided in table 1. below.

### Key Findings

Below are the key findings summarized from table 1. for how the
therapeutic threshold affects the onset-duration trade-off.

1.  Pill duration advantage persists for $A_{eff} \leq 140$ mg. Below
    this threshold, pill delivery maintains therapeutic levels 1-10%
    longer than IV despite the slower onset.

2.  IV onset advantage increases with $A_{eff}$. At low thresholds
    ($A_{eff} = 20$ mg), IV administration is 2.5× faster and at high
    thresholds ($A_{eff} = 140$ mg), IV administration is 3.5× faster.

3.  Critical crossover occurs when $A_{eff} \approx 150$ mg. Above this
    value, both onset AND duration favor the IV delivery method, making
    pills clinically inferior in comparison.

4.  For $A_{eff} \in [60, 120]$ mg, the pill delivery method offers
    meaningful duration advantages (3-5% longer) with acceptable onset
    delays (under 1 hour).

![Effect of effective threshold $A_{eff}$ on delivery method
performance. (a) Onset time increases with $A_{eff}$ for both methods,
with pills consistently slower. (b) Duration decreases with $A_{eff}$,
showing crossover around 150 mg. (c) Onset ratio (Pill/IV) remains above
1, indicating pills are always slower. (d) Duration ratio shows pill
advantage (ratio $>$ 1) for $A_{eff} \leq 140$ mg, then switches to IV
advantage.](Aeff_analysis.pdf){#fig:aeff_analysis width="90%"}

## Effect of Infusion Rate ($r$) for IV

Prior to simulations, the standing assumption is that higher infusion
rates should decrease onset time but potentially increase peak
concentrations and safety risks [@Rowland2011; @Katzung2021].
Testing $r \in [20, 100]$ mg/hr with $A_{eff} = 80$ mg, $h = 4$ hrs,
$c = 0.1$ hr$^{-1}$, we observe the following results provided in table
2. below.

  : Effect of infusion rate on IV performance
:::

**Key Finding:** For $A_{eff} = 80$ mg, infusion rates below $r = 30$
mg/hr fail to provide adequate onset speed or duration. The optimal
range is $r \in [40, 60]$ mg/hr, which balances rapid onset (0.14-0.20
hrs) with good duration (11-13 hrs) while maintaining safe peak levels
(\<230 mg).

![Comparison of IV versus pill delivery over 24 hours with base
parameters ($r=50$ mg/hr, $D_{max}=200$ mg/hr, $h=4$ hrs, $c=0.1$
hr$^{-1}$). IV (blue) shows sharp rise to peak at $t=4$ hrs followed by
exponential decay. Pill (red) shows gradual rise with earlier, lower
peak followed by gradual decay. Both methods exceed the effective
threshold $A_{eff}=80$ mg (green dashed line) for over 10 hours. Safety
threshold $A_{safe}=250$ mg (orange dashed line) is not exceeded by
either method.](comparison_plot.pdf){#fig:comparison width="75%"}

## Effect of Administration Duration ($h$)

Prior to simulations, the standing assumption is that Longer
administration durations should increase total drug delivered,
potentially extending duration but delaying peaks. Testing
$h \in [2, 10]$ hours with fixed $r = 50$ mg/hr, $D_{max} = 200$ mg/hr,
$c = 0.1$ hr$^{-1}$, $A_{eff} = 80$ mg, we observe the following results
provided in table 3. below.

### Key Findings

Below are the key findings summarized from table 3. for whether the
administration duration ($h$) impacts the total amount of drug
delivered. The most major finding is that administration duration has
asymmetric effects summarized below:

-   IV onset is constant (always 0.16 hrs), meaning it is entirely
    independent of the administration duration $h$

-   Pill onset increases linearly with $h$ (approximately 0.1 hrs per
    hour of $h$)

-   Both methods show linear duration increase: approximately 2.4 hrs
    per hour of $h$

-   Pill duration advantage grows from 0.8 hrs at $h=2$ to 2.6 hrs at
    $h=10$

**Clinical Implication:** For sustained symptom control (e.g., a patient
who needs overnight relief), we recommend the use of $h \geq 8$ hours
with pill administration for 24+ hour coverage.

![Clinical scenario comparison. Left: Pain killer scenario ($r=100$
mg/hr, $D_{max}=300$ mg/hr, $h=2$ hrs) prioritizing rapid onset. IV
reaches effective level in 5 minutes versus 20 minutes for pill. Right:
Allergy relief scenario ($r=30$ mg/hr, $D_{max}=120$ mg/hr, $h=8$ hrs)
prioritizing sustained effect. Pill maintains effective levels for 18.4
hours versus 14.2 hours for IV, providing 30% longer symptom
control.](scenario_comparison.pdf){#fig:scenarios width="90%"}

## Effect of Clearance Rate ($c$)

The standing assumption is that clearance rates can vary between
patients due to a myriad of factors including, but not limited to; age
(elderly have slower clearance), kidney/liver function, drug
interactions, and genetic factors [@StatPearls2024]. Testing
$c \in [0.05, 0.25]$ hr$^{-1}$ with $r = 50$ mg/hr, $D_{max} = 200$
mg/hr, $h = 4$ hrs, $A_{eff} = 80$ mg, we observe the following results
provided in table 4. below.

  : Effect of patient clearance rate
:::

Below are the key findings summarized from table 4. showcasing the
effects at various patient clearance rates.

1.  **Slow metabolizers ($c = 0.05$ hr$^{-1}$):**

    -   Pill delivery provides 27.6-hour coverage (can cover overnight
        symptoms spanning more than a full day)

    -   The onset delay is only 0.26 hrs ($\approx$ 15 minutes)

    Under the above conditions, our group recommends that pill delivery
    is strongly preferred for treating patients.

2.  **Average metabolizers ($c = 0.10$ hr$^{-1}$):**

    -   The trade-off is more balanced, where the pill gives 0.6 extra
        hours of coverage

    -   The onset delay is 0.35 hrs ($\approx$ 21 minutes)

    Under the above conditions, our group determines that the choice of
    delivery is dependent on the clinical urgency present at the time of
    drug administration.

3.  **Fast metabolizers ($c = 0.25$ hr$^{-1}$):**

    -   The drug impact duration is extremely short for both methods
        (\<6 hours)

    -   The pill onset delay exceeds 1.5 hours

    Under the above conditions, our group recommends that IV
    administration should be the preferred delivery method. However, we
    note that repeated doses may be required.

# Parameter Space Mapping - Trade-off Score Analysis

We define a composite trade-off score:

$$S = \frac{t_{duration}}{t_{onset}}$$\
Higher scores indicate better sustained therapeutic value. We map this
score across the $(r, h)$ parameter space for IV delivery. The optimal
region for high trade-off scores (sustained effect) is; $r \in [40, 60]$
mg/hr (moderate infusion rates), $h \in [6, 10]$ hours (extended
administration), with a peak score $S \approx 170$ at
$(r, h) = (40, 10)$. Conversely, rapid-onset protocols sacrifice
sustained effect when $r \geq 80$ mg/hr, $h \leq 3$ hours with
$S \approx 80$ (more than half the sustained effect).

![Parameter space analysis for IV delivery. (a) Heat map of trade-off
score $S=t_{duration}/t_{onset}$ across $(r,h)$ space. Warmer colors

dramatically reduces duration for both methods, but effect is more

# Clinical Decision Framework

Based on our comprehensive parameter analysis above, our group proposes
the following decision tree for medical professionals to follow when
deciding what form of delivery will best treat a patients symptoms [@Rowland2011].

## Step 1: Determine Required Onset Speed

For emergency situations where a patient has acute symptoms and
$t_{onset} < 0.3$ hours is required, our group recommends the use of IV
administration with infusion rate $r \geq 50$ mg/hr, and an
administration duration $h \leq 4$ hours. We do not recommend using pill
delivery, as pill formulations cannot achieve this onset speed required
to treat a patient with such symptoms [@Rowland2011; @Katzung2021]. If a patient does not need such
urgent treatment, i.e., ($t_{onset} < 1$ hour is acceptable, then pill
delivery is acceptable if the other patient factors favour it.

## Step 2: Assess Effective Threshold ($A_{eff}$)

When a low threshold ($A_{eff} \leq 80$ mg) is necessary for treatment,
our group notes that pill delivery provides 3-10% longer effective
duration with an onset delay under 1 hour. Thus, pill delivery is
recommended for sustained treatment.

For a moderate threshold ($80 < A_{eff} \leq 140$ mg) required for
treatment, our group notes that pill delivery still maintains a slight
effective duration advantage of around 1-3% with an onset delay between
1-1.5 hours. This choice is balanced, and it is advised to consult the
patient on which method of delivery they find more convenient.

For a high threshold ($A_{eff} > 140$ mg) required for treatment, our
group notes that IV administration is superior for both onset and
effective duration. Thus, we highly recommend that IV administration is
used to treat patients who require such doses.

## Step 3: Consider Patient Clearance Rate

When a patient presenting symptoms is a slow metabolizer ($c \leq 0.075$
hr$^{-1}$), our group notes that pill delivery will provide over 20
hours of coverage with minimal onset penalty. Thus, it is strongly
advised to treat patients with slow metabolic rate using pill delivery.

When a patient presenting symptoms is a fast metabolizer ($c \geq 0.20$
hr$^{-1}$), our group notes that both pill delivery and IV
administration will provide limited effective duration. However, we note
that the IV onset advantage is critical, and that it should be the
preferred method of administration when multiple doses are considered
for patient care.

## Step 4: Optimize Administration Protocol

Summarizing the above steps, we note that if the goal is that of
sustained coverage, use an administration duration $h \geq 6$ hours,
moderate infusion rates ($r = 40-50$ mg/hr for IV), and pill delivery
formulations with $D_{max}h \geq 800$ mg total release into the patients
system.

If the goal of treatment is rapid relief, then we recommend using an
administration duration $h = 2-3$ hours, a high infusion rate
($r \geq 80$ mg/hr for IV), and that medical professionals monitor the
patient for peak concentration safety.

Using the above recommended decision tree framework, we take a look at
some sample cases studies to see which method of treatment would be most
optimal for the patient.

# Case Studies

## Case 1: Chronic Pain Management

**Patient Profile:** The patient is a 65-year-old with osteoarthritis,
has an estimated metabolic rate of $c = 0.075$ hr$^{-1}$ (slow
metabolizer), the required dosage for treatment is $A_{eff} = 60$ mg,
and the patient requires 24-hour coverage.

**Analysis:**

-   Pill with $h = 8$ hours: Duration = 24.4 hours, Onset = 0.35 hours

-   IV with $h = 8$ hours: Duration = 22.8 hours, Onset = 0.16 hours

**Group Recommendation:** Slow-release pill delivery. The 1.6-hour
additional coverage ensures uninterrupted overnight relief, and
21-minute onset delay is clinically acceptable for chronic pain.

## Case 2: Acute Migraine

**Patient Profile:** The patient is a 35-year-old with a severe
migraine, has an estimated metabolism of $c = 0.10$ hr$^{-1}$, the
required dosage is $A_{eff} = 100$ mg, and the patient required
immediate relief.\
**Analysis:**

-   IV with $r = 100$ mg/hr, $h = 2$ hrs: Onset = 0.10 hours (6 min)

-   Pill with $h = 2$ hrs: Onset = 0.71 hours (43 min)

**Group Recommendation:** IV infusion administration. The 37-minute
difference in onset is critical for acute symptom relief for the patient
with a migraine. The high $A_{eff}$ also makes IV superior for duration.

## Case 3: Post-surgical Recovery

**Patient Profile:** The patient is a 50-year-old who is in
post-operative care. The patient has an estimated metabolic rate of
$c = 0.10$ hr$^{-1}$, needs a required dosage of $A_{eff} = 70$ mg, and
requires 12-hour coverage for first day, and then transition to home
care.\
**Analysis:**

-   Day 1 (hospital): IV with $r = 50$ mg/hr, $h = 4$ hrs: Duration =
    14.2 hours

-   Day 2+ (home): Pill with $h = 6$ hrs: Duration = 19.1 hours

**Group Recommendation:** Start with IV administration for predictable
hospital management, then transition to pill for convenient home
administration with sustained coverage.

# Limitations and Future Work

## Model Limitations

One of the major limitations is the linear clearance assumption. Real
clearance may saturate at high concentrations. Additionally, there is
the fact that both models are one-compartment models, and do not account
for tissue distribution and peripheral compartments. The next limitation
is bioavailability, which is the notion that actual drug absorption may
have delays and variable bioavailability. Lastly is the assumption of
constant parameters. Both the clearance rate $c$ and max dosage
$D_{max}$ may vary with circadian rhythms and food intake [@Rowland2011; @StatPearls2024].

# Conclusions

Through systematic numerical simulation across extensive parameter
space, we have identified precise conditions under which slow-release
pill formulations provide superior therapeutic outcomes compared to
rapid IV infusion:

1.  **Effective threshold is the primary determinant:** Pills outperform
    IV for duration when $A_{eff} \leq 140$ mg, with optimal advantage
    at $A_{eff} \in [60, 100]$ mg.

2.  **Patient clearance rate modulates outcomes:** Slow metabolizers
    ($c \leq 0.075$ hr$^{-1}$) benefit dramatically from pills (20+ hour
    coverage), while fast metabolizers ($c \geq 0.20$ hr$^{-1}$) require
    IV for adequate therapeutic action.

3.  **Administration duration amplifies duration advantage:** Extended
    protocols ($h \geq 6$ hours) increase pill's relative advantage by
    50-100%, making them ideal for overnight or full-day symptom
    control.

4.  **IV maintains universal onset superiority:** Across all tested
    parameters, IV achieves effective levels 2-4× faster than pills,
    making it irreplaceable for acute interventions.

5.  **Quantitative decision framework:** Our analysis provides specific
    parameter thresholds to guide clinical decision-making, balancing
    onset speed, duration, and patient-specific factors.

This work demonstrates that the \"slow but long\" vs \"fast but short\"
trade-off is not universal but depends critically on the interplay
between drug properties ($A_{eff}$), patient characteristics ($c$), and
dosing protocols ($r$, $h$, $D_{max}$). Optimal delivery method
selection requires quantitative analysis of these factors rather than
qualitative assumptions.
